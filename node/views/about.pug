        h1 What's all this then?
        p Itâ€™s all about Pointless Whimsy
        p Once a week we pick a random theme, three things the story has to contain, and limit ourselves to 500 words.
    h1 What's with the name?
    p Pointless whimsy, innit. Or an excuse for appealing puns, for shredding conventions, for laying on the sweetness thick and fruity, for as long as you can Paddington Bear it.
    h1 500 words to read while you're:
